# Data Analyst Skills Analysis - Canada 2023

## Introduction
This project analyzes the top-paying skills for data analyst positions in Canada in 2023, a year marking the early post-COVID hiring rebound. Using a dataset of skills and their average yearly salaries, the goal was to identify trends in skill demand and salary distribution to provide insights for professionals seeking high-paying data analyst roles. SQL queries used in the analysis are stored in the [project_sql_final folder](/project_sql_final/) for reference and reproducibility.

## Background
The dataset provided a list of skills required for data analyst jobs, along with their average annual salaries, sourced from job postings in Canada in 2023. This analysis builds on a prior exploration of top-paying data job roles, focusing specifically on data analyst positions to understand which skills command the highest salaries and why.

## Tools I Used
- **Python**: For data processing and visualization, using libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for creating bar plots.

- **SQL**: For querying and aggregating data from the dataset to extract skill frequencies and average salaries.

- **CSV/JSON**: For handling input data, including the provided JSON dataset of skills and salaries and a prior CSV dataset for broader data roles.

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: Used as the primary environment for writing and running Python and SQL code to process data and generate visualizations.

## The Analysis
The analysis involved querying and processing the dataset to extract insights on skill salaries:
- **Data Querying**: Used SQL to query the dataset, aggregating skill frequencies and calculating average salaries per skill.

- **Data Cleaning**: Converted the JSON and CSV data into structured formats, ensuring salaries were numeric and skills were consistently formatted using Python.

- **Visualization**: Generated bar plots with `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to visualize the top 10 skills by frequency (from CSV data) and average salary (from JSON data).

### What I Learned
- **Advanced SQL & Data Querying:** I enhanced my experience in complex SQL query crafting, including table merging and `WITH` clause utilization, to develop reusable scripts for extracting key insights such as skill frequencies and salary data.

- **Data Processing & Aggregation:** I became proficient in cleaning and preparing diverse datasets (JSON/CSV) using Python, integrating SQL within VS Code, and applied `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `AVG()`) for comprehensive data summarization.

- **Insight Generation & Visualization:** I effectively translated complex problems into actionable SQL queries, resulting in professional data visualizations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to communicate findings clearly.

### Conclusions
1. **SQL remains essential**: It appeared in the highest number of job postings and continues to be a must-have for most data analyst roles across Canada.

2. **Python stands out**:  While slightly less in demand than SQL, it commands a higher average salary, showing its growing value in automation and advanced analytics.

3. **Excel is still relevant, but less lucrative**: It shows up frequently but is more common in junior roles with lower average pay.

4. **Specialized tools = higher pay**: Skills like Unify, GCP, and Hadoop top the salary chart, suggesting that niche expertise leads to stronger compensation.

5. **Skill breadth vs. depth matters**: Broad foundational skills help land interviews, but deeper specialization in modern stacks is what drives top-tier salaries.
